# SuperConnect

**Description**: We aim to deploy a Layer 2 blockchain using the OP Stack to enhance scalability and user experience. It will support decentralized applications (dApps) with seamless login via WorldID, fostering a robust ecosystem that simplifies blockchain access and encourages innovation.

**Idea**: We aim to deploy a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain utilizing the OP Stack framework, specifically designed to enhance scalability and user experience. This new chain will facilitate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) while integrating login functionalities through WorldID, allowing users to authenticate their identities seamlessly.

Key components of the project include:

- OP Stack: This will serve as the foundational technology for building the L2 environment.
- WorldCoin: Users will log in using WorldID, which will also enable gasless transactions, optimizing the cost of operations on the network.
- Farcaster: This will provide a platform for users to log in and publish content, enhancing user engagement within the dApps.
- Blockscout: Instead of traditional explorers like Etherscan, Blockscout will be employed to track transactions on the new chain.
- Tenderly: This tool will be utilized for debugging, ensuring that the dApps function smoothly.
- Conduit: This will assist in deploying the OP Stack efficiently.

The overall vision is to create a robust ecosystem that not only supports the deployment of the chain but also encourages the development of innovative dApps, making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.
**Blockers**: Not at the moment, but there's one thing that we need some feedback on with our chain's utility on cross-chain transfer and its eligibility for the hack.
